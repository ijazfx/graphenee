# Graphenee
Graphenee - Enterprise Application Development Framework

Graphenee word itself is a combination of Graphene and Enterprise Edition (ee).

The motivation behind this framework is to give developers an easy to use api to quickly build enterprise applications by focusing on business logic.

Development of the Graphenee was started in April 2016 in a private bitbucket repository. On May 10, I decided to put it on Github public repository for the opensource community.

I believe the framework has a lot of potential and there is huge room for improvement. I welcome the opensource community to review and improve the code, develop and contribute modules and make Graphenee a successful for enterprise application development.
